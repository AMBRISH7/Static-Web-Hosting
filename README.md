This image helps you to learn how to implement an AWS CodeDeploy and CodePipeline project for an automated and continuous delivery of application deployments. It clearly explains the functionality and significance of CodeDeploy in automating application deployment to various environments including Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises servers or Lambda functions. Here is the detailed explaination of the project.
Step 1: Create IAM Roles
Create an IAM role for EC2 with AmazonS3FullAccess permission and another for CodeDeploy with AWSCodeDeployRole permission.
Attach these roles to the EC2 instance and CodeDeploy, respectively.

Step 2: Set Up Developer Access
Create an IAM user with AmazonS3FullAccess and AWSCodeDeployFullAccess permissions.
Configure AWS CLI on the developer’s machine using the IAM user credentials.

Step 3: Prepare the Web Server
Launch an EC2 instance and open port 80 in its security group.
SSH into the instance and install the CodeDeploy agent using the following commands:
bash
Copy
Edit
yum update
yum install ruby -y
yum install wget -y
wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x install
./install auto

Step 4: Create Application Code
Create a directory for your app (/root/deploy_dir).
Add an appspec.yml, an index.html, and scripts (e.g., httpd_install.sh) for deployment.
Compress the files into a zip (sampleapp.zip).

Step 5: Upload Code to S3
Create an S3 bucket and upload the sampleapp.zip file:
bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 cp sampleapp.zip s3://your-bucket-name

Step 6: Create CodeDeploy Application
In the CodeDeploy console, create an application and a deployment group.
Assign the appropriate IAM role and include your EC2 instance using tags.

Step 7: Deploy the Application
Use the CodeDeploy console to deploy the app from the S3 bucket to the EC2 instance.
Test the deployment by accessing the EC2 instance’s public IP in a browser.

Step 8: Set Up CodePipeline
Create a pipeline in the CodePipeline console.
Configure S3 as the source, skip the build stage, and add CodeDeploy as the deploy stage.

Step 9: Test Automatic Updates
Modify the app code (e.g., change text in index.html) and upload the updated zip file to the S3 bucket.
CodePipeline will detect the change and automatically deploy the update to the EC2 instance.

This process automates your deployments and ensures continuous delivery with AWS services!
